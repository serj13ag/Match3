# Match3

My own implementation of a match three puzzle game from Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/make-a-puzzle-match-game-in-unity/

I was following the course step by step, but implemented features in my way.
There is a single entry poind in application - "Bootstrapper", defined composition root of services, dependency injection, state machine for handling different game states.
